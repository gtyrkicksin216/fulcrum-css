#0.3.1 (2019-06-26)
## Contributing
Stylelint has been added. Prior to contributing make sure you now run `npm run lint:fix`. This will automatically fix any linting errors. If there are still errors after this you will need to fix them on your own. The following files listed in the output below can be ignored:

```cmd
scss/modules/_keyword-sizes.scss
 36:15  ‼  Expected nesting depth to be no more than 5   max-nesting-depth
 44:15  ‼  Expected nesting depth to be no more than 5   max-nesting-depth

```

### Bug Fixes
- Fixing an issue with the flex grid hiding Material input labels when the input was focused (#22 closing #24)

- Fixed an issue where text was being overridden by the heading-size module. This module was removed as it is not within the scope of this library (#26 closing #25)

# 0.3.0 (2019-04-19)
### Features
- Added flex grid
  - Extremely useful for forms or layouts that require more rigidity while still being responsive.
  - **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Flex grid only has a specificity of 10, unlike the rest of Fulcrum which has a specificity of 20. This is by design as the flex-grid is meant to be a light layout utility, while still being able to take other Fulcrum classes for overrides. Flex column on the other hand has a specificity of 20.
  - Syntax:
    - `.u-flex-grid`: The wrapper for rows and elements
    - `.u-flex-row`: A row element. Wrapper for columns
    - `.u-flex-column`: A column element.
      - `.m--<size[small|medium|large]>-<width[1-12]>`: The amount of space the column will take up out of the 12 column grid
  - Example:
      ```html
      <div class="u-flex-grid">
        <div class="u-flex-row">
          <div class="u-flex-column m--small-1"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      ```

# 0.2.1 (2019-04-17)
### Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue where using `padding-[block|inline]` with keywords was using margin instead of padding (#6008e66 closing #13)

# 0.2.0 (2019-04-03)
### Features
- Margin and padding for elements has been updated:
  - Margins and paddings now have three different options so you do not have to add multiple classNames where you could use one
  - Syntax:
    - `.u-[margin|padding]-all-[number|keyword]`: Will add margin or padding at the block-start, block-end, inline-start, and inline-end
    - `.u-[margin|padding]-block-[number|keyword]`: Will add margin or padding at the block-start and block-end of the element
    - `.u-[margin|padding]-inline-[number|keyword]`: Will add margin or padding at the inline-start and inline-end of the element

### Bug Fixes
- Removed `includes` from modules and added to main stylesheet. This fixes an issue that was causing dupes if you wanted custom sizing (for things like spacers, margin, etc.) and included the file where needed.


# 0.1.0-rc4 (2019-02-15)
- Keyword spacers are here! 😄
  - Available sizes are:
    - `small`: 15px
    - `medium`: 30px
    - `large`: 45px
    - `x-large`: 60px
  - These can also be used for margin and padding
  - Syntax: `<div class="u-spacer-large"></div>`

# 0.1.0-rc3 (2019-01-22)
### Features
- Added `fontColor` and `textTransform` mixins (#5) (1450a7b) Closes #1 Closes #4 Closes #2
- `fontColor` usage:
  - **Syntax:** `u-font-color-<primary|accent|warn|normal>`
    ```html
    ...
    <p class="u-font-color-primary">Some text</p>
    ...
    ```
  - Can be customized by providing custom color values. The order is as follows
    - `@include fontColor($primary, $accent, $warn, $normal);`
- `textTransform` usage:
  - **Syntax:** `u-text-transform-<none|capitalize|uppercase|lowercase|full-width>`
    ```html
    ...
    <p class="u-text-transform-uppercase">Some text</p>
    ...
    ```
  - **Cannot** be customized by using `@include`

# 0.1.0-rc2 (2019-01-16)
